# Support

For help with Molen, please use one of these channels:

- [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/bendyline/molen/issues/new) for
  questions, bug reports, and feature or capability requests that can be
  discussed publicly.
- Email [support@bendyline.com](mailto:support@bendyline.com) if your request
  includes private or sensitive information, or if email is more appropriate.

When asking for help, include the affected package and version, the behavior
you expected, the behavior you observed, and a minimal reproduction when
possible. Please do not include credentials, private data, or other secrets in
a public issue.

A scene manifest is usually the smallest useful reproduction. `molen validate`
and `molen sim run <scene> --ticks N --hash` run without a browser, so a scene
plus the printed state hash is often enough to show what you are seeing. If the
problem is visual, `molen shot <scene> --out shot.png` renders one deterministic
frame headlessly.

Potential security vulnerabilities should be reported according to our
[Security Policy](SECURITY.md).
